**Most people know “Fizz buzz” as a group word game designed to teach children about division (or drinking game). Many programmers are also quite familiar with Fizz buzz as “FizzBuzz”, in the form of a trivial programming problem. It is often used as a job interview screening device to weed out (really (really (really))) (really) bad applicants. This repository contains a small collection of awful implementations of FizzBuzz for various programming languages.**
